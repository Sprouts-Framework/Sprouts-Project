## Introduction 
Sprouts Framework is based on Spring MVC 3. It provides a template with many classes . Thanks to this template, you will spend less time in developing use cases, since it abstracts you from repetitive tasks that may derive in code errors and bugs. Thanks to this abstraction, you will be able to develop case uses in less than two minutes.
## Features and technologies
- [Spring MVC](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) 3 as backend.
- [JSP](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/jsp/index.html) for HTML generation.
- [Datatables](https://datatables.net/) for listing and supporting pagination.
- Integration with [Spring Social](http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/) for allowing users to register and log in to the web application using their social network accounts.
- Integration with [Hibernate Search](http://hibernate.org/search/) in order to support full-text search.
- Integration with [Drools](https://www.drools.org/) for creating and triggering business rules.
- Customizable formatters and parsers. Sprouts Framework gives you the chance to decide how the information will be displayed for each view depending on the language selected by the user.
- Security: Sprouts prevents your web application from non-authorized access and POST-hacking, improving the security layer provided by Spring Security.
- Class structures and methodologies which will allow you to create use cases quickly, avoiding repetitive tasks. 

## Documentation
You can find the documentation in the following links. At this moment, it is just available in Spanish:
- Getting started: this document provides a quick overview on the framework. By following it, you will be able to instantiate a prject with Sprouts and create basic use cases.
- User's manual: contains a deep technical description about Sprouts Framework. It explains and justifies the implementation of every aspect and component of it.
